# Team Profile Generator ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

## Description

The Team Profile Generator is a command-line application designed to streamline the process of creating a comprehensive HTML webpage that showcases the key information of your software engineering team.
This application simplifies the task by prompting the user to enter details for each team member, including Managers, Engineers, and Interns. The user is guided through a series of prompts, allowing them to input specific information based on the team member's role. Once all the necessary details are provided, the application dynamically generates an HTML page that neatly organizes and displays each team member's information.

This application utilizes Node.js and the Inquirer package to efficiently gather user input and Jest for testing to ensure the reliability of the generated HTML. With the Team Profile Generator, you can spend more time focusing on the development of your project while ensuring that your team's information is well-documented and easily accessible.
